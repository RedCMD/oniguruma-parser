# oniguruma-parser: Tokenizer module

Used by the [parser](https://github.com/slevithan/oniguruma-parser/tree/main/src/parser) to convert Oniguruma pattern and flags strings to a list of tokens, as the first step in builing an AST.

This module is not exported by oniguruma-parser, as tokenization is considered an implementation detail of the parser.
