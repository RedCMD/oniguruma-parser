`oniguruma-parser` is a TypeScript library for parsing, validating, traversing, transforming, and optimizing [Oniguruma](https://github.com/kkos/oniguruma) regular expressions. It's been battle-tested by [`oniguruma-to-es`](https://github.com/slevithan/oniguruma-to-es) and [`tm-grammars`](https://github.com/shikijs/textmate-grammars-themes), which are used by [Shiki](https://shiki.style/) to process tens of thousands of real-world Oniguruma regexes.

> Oniguruma is an advanced regular expression engine written in C that's used in Ruby (via a fork named Onigmo), PHP (`mb_ereg`, etc.), TextMate grammars (used by VS Code, GitHub, etc.), and many other tools.

## Install and use

```sh
npm install oniguruma-parser
```

```js
import {toOnigurumaAst} from 'oniguruma-parser';

const ast = toOnigurumaAst('.*');
console.log(ast.pattern.alternatives[0].elements[0]);
/* â†’ {
  type: 'Quantifier',
  kind: 'greedy',
  min: 0,
  max: Infinity,
  element: {
    type: 'CharacterSet',
    kind: 'dot',
  },
} */
```

The following modules are available in addition to the root `'oniguruma-parser'` export:

- [Parser module](https://github.com/slevithan/oniguruma-parser/blob/main/src/parser/README.md): Includes `parse` which is similar to `toOnigurumaAst` but adds options for specialized use. Also exports numerous functions and types for constructing and working with `OnigurumaAst` nodes.
- [Generator module](https://github.com/slevithan/oniguruma-parser/blob/main/src/generator/README.md): Convert an `OnigurumaAst` to pattern and flags strings.
- [Optimizer module](https://github.com/slevithan/oniguruma-parser/blob/main/src/optimizer/README.md): Minify and improve the performance of Oniguruma regexes.
- [Traverser module](https://github.com/slevithan/oniguruma-parser/blob/main/src/traverser/README.md): Traverse and transform an `OnigurumaAst`.

## Generate an AST

To parse an Oniguruma regex pattern (with optional flags and compile-time options) and return an AST, call `toOnigurumaAst`, which uses the following type definition:

```ts
function toOnigurumaAst(
  pattern: string,
  options?: {
    flags?: string;
    rules?: {
      captureGroup?: boolean;
      singleline?: boolean;
    };
  }
): OnigurumaAst;
```

An error is thrown if the pattern or flags aren't valid in Oniguruma.

## Traverse and transform an AST

See details and examples in the [traverser module's readme](https://github.com/slevithan/oniguruma-parser/blob/main/src/traverser/README.md).

## Optimize regexes

This library includes one of the few implementations (for any regex flavor) of a "regex optimizer" that can minify and improve the performance and readability of regexes prior to use. Such transformations must be specific to a particular regex flavor in order to be accurate, and `oniguruma-parser`'s [optimizer module](https://github.com/slevithan/oniguruma-parser/blob/main/src/optimizer/README.md) is of course built for Oniguruma regexes.

Example:

```
(?x) (?:\!{1,}) (\p{Nd}aa|\p{Nd}ab|\p{Nd}az) [[^0-9A-Fa-f]\p{ Letter }] [\p{L}\p{M}\p{N}\p{Pc}]
```

Becomes:

```
!+(\da[abz])[\H\p{L}]\w
```

Optimized regexes always match exactly the same strings.

## Known differences

Known differences will be resolved in future versions.

### Unsupported features that throw an error

The following rarely-used features throw errors since they aren't yet supported:

- Rarely-used character specifiers: Non-A-Za-z with `\cx` `\C-x`, meta `\M-x` `\M-\C-x`, bracketed octals `\o{â€¦}`, and octal encoded bytes â‰¥ `\200`.
- Code point sequences: `\x{H H â€¦}`, `\o{O O â€¦}`.
- Absent expressions `(?~|â€¦|â€¦)`, stoppers `(?~|â€¦)`, and clearers `(?~|)`.
- Conditionals: `(?(â€¦)â€¦)`, etc.
- Callouts: `(?{â€¦})`, `(*â€¦)`, etc.
- Numbered *forward* backreferences (incl. relative `\k<+N>`) and backreferences with recursion level (`\k<N+N>`, etc.).
- Flags `y{g}`/`y{w}` (grapheme boundary modes); whole-pattern modifiers `C` (don't capture group), `I` (ignore-case is ASCII), `L` (find longest); flags `D`, `P`, `S`, `W` (digit/POSIX/space/word is ASCII) within mode modifiers.

Despite these gaps, **more than 99.99% of real-world Oniguruma regexes are supported**, based on a sample of ~55k regexes used in TextMate grammars (conditionals were used in three regexes, and other unsupported features weren't used at all). Some of the Oniguruma features above are so exotic that they aren't used in *any* public code on GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>More details about numbered forward backreferences</summary>

This library currently treats it as an error if a numbered backreference comes before its referenced group. This is a rare issue because:

- Most such placements are mistakes and can never match, due to Oniguruma's behavior for backreferences to nonparticipating groups.
- Erroring matches the correct behavior of named backreferences.
- For unenclosed backreferences, this only affects `\1`â€“`\9` since it's not a backreference in the first place if using `\10` or higher and not as many capturing groups are defined to the left (it's an octal or identity escape).
</details>

### Unsupported validation errors

The following don't yet throw errors, but should:

- Special characters that are invalid in backreference names even when referencing a valid group with that name.
  - Named backreferences should use a more limited set of allowed characters than named groups and subroutines.
  - Note that an error is already correctly thrown for any backreference name that includes `-` or `+` (which is separate from how these symbols are used in relative *numbered* backreferences).
- Subroutines used in ways that resemble infinite recursion ([#5](https://github.com/slevithan/oniguruma-parser/issues/5)).
  - Such subroutines error at compile time in Oniguruma.

### Behavior differences

#### Unenclosed four-digit backreferences

Although any number of digits are supported for enclosed `\k<â€¦>`/`\k'â€¦'` backreferences (assuming the backreference refers to a valid capturing group), unenclosed backreferences currently support only up to three digits (`\999`). In other words, `\1000` is handled as `\100` followed by `0` even if 1,000+ captures appear to the left.

Note that, although Oniguruma theoretically supports `\1000` and higher when as many capturing groups appear to the left, Oniguruma regexes with more than 999 captures never actually work. They fail to match anything, with no error, due to an apparent bug. Tested in Oniguruma 6.9.8 via `vscode-oniguruma`.

#### Erroring on patterns that trigger Oniguruma bugs

This library currently throws an error for several edge cases that trigger Oniguruma bugs.

<details>
  <summary>Nested absent functions</summary>

Although nested absent functions like `(?~(?~â€¦))` don't throw an error in Oniguruma, they produce self-described "strange" results, and Oniguruma's docs state that "nested absent functions are not supported and the behavior is undefined".

In this library, they throw an error.

> In future versions, parsing of nested absent functions will follow Oniguruma and no longer error.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Bare <code>\x</code> as a <code>NUL</code> character</summary>

> **Context:** `\xH`, `\xHH`, and `\x{Hâ€¦}` are all supported, where *H* is a hexadecimal digit. The following describes the use of `\x` on its own, when it's not a part of any of these forms.

In Oniguruma, `\x` is an escape for the `NUL` character (equivalent to `\0`, `\x0`, `\x00`, etc.) if it's not followed by `{` or a hexadecimal digit.

In this library, it throws an error.

The error is thrown because `\x` is buggy in Oniguruma. It's also ambiguous, non-portable across regex flavors, offers no user benefit (`\0` is equally short), unintuitive, and not relied on by users (none of the Oniguruma regexes in a sample of tens of thousands used it).

Behavior details for `\x` in Oniguruma:

- `\x` is an identity escape (matching a literal `x`) if it appears at the very end of a pattern. *This is an apparent bug.*
- `\x` is an error if followed by a `{` that's followed by a hexadecimal digit but doesn't form a valid `\x{â€¦}` code point escape. Ex: `\x{F` and `\x{0,2}` are errors.
- `\x` is an identity escape (matching a literal `x`) if followed by a `{` that isn't followed by a hexadecimal digit. Ex: `\x{` matches `x{`, `\x{G` matches `x{G`, `\x{}` matches `x{}`, and `\x{,2}` matches 0â€“2 `x` characters, since `{,2}` is a quantifier with an implicit 0 min.

> In future versions, parsing of `\x` will follow Oniguruma's complicated rules above, removing some cases where it currently errors. However, this library intentionally doesn't reproduce Oniguruma bugs, so a pattern-terminating `\x` will be treated as a `NUL` character (like at all other positions) rather than a literal `x`. If necessary, you can check for this and throw an error.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Pattern-terminating bare <code>\u</code> as an identity escape</summary>

Normally, any incomplete `\uHHHH` (including bare `\u`) throws an error. However, in Oniguruma, bare `\u` is treated as an identity escape (matching a literal `u`) if it appears at the very end of a pattern. *This is an apparent bug.*

In this library, incomplete `\u` is always an error.

> This library intentionally doesn't reproduce Oniguruma bugs, so a pattern-terminating `\u` will continue to error in future versions (as it does in Oniguruma at other positions).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Invalid standalone encoded bytes <code>\x80</code> to <code>\xFF</code></summary>

> **Context:** Unlike enclosed `\x{HH}`, unenclosed `\xHH` represents an encoded byte (not a Unicode code unit or code point), which means that `\x80` to `\xFF` are treated as fragments of a code unit, unlike in other regex flavors. Ex: `[\0-\xE2\x82\xAC]` is equivalent to `[\0-\u20AC]`.

Oniguruma docs simply state: "Do not pass invalid byte string in the regex character encoding."

In this library, invalid encoded byte sequences throw an error.

Behavior details for invalid encoded bytes in Oniguruma:

- Standalone `\x80` to `\xBF` throw error "invalid code point value".
- Standalone `\xC0` to `\xF4` throw error "too short multibyte code string".
- Standalone `\xF5` to `\xFF` fail to match anything, but don't throw. *This is an apparent bug.*

> This library intentionally doesn't reproduce Oniguruma bugs. So, in future versions, standalone `\xF5` to `\xFF` will continue to error (if not at the end of a character class range, as described below).

Oniguruma's behavior changes if an invalid encoded byte is used as the end value of a character class range:

> **Context:** The on-by-default Oniguruma compile-time option `ONIG_SYN_ALLOW_INVALID_CODE_END_OF_RANGE_IN_CC` means that invalid encoded byte or code point values used at the end of character class ranges are treated as if they were the last preceding valid value. Ex: `[\0-\x{FFFFFFFF}]` is equivalent to `[\0-\x{10FFFF}]`, and `[\0-\xFF]` is equivalent to `[\0-\x7F]` (or rather, it should be, as described below).

- Standalone `\x80` to `\xBF` are treated as `\x7F`.
- Standalone `\xC0` to `\xF4` throw error "too short multibyte code string". *This is an apparent bug.*
- Standalone `\xF5` to `\xFF` are treated as `\x7F`.
  - If the range is within a negated, non-nested character class (ex: `[^\0-\xFF]`), `\xF5` to `\xFF` are treated as `\x{10FFFF}`. *This is an apparent bug, and can be worked around by nesting the class (ex: `[[^\0-\xFF]]`).*

> In future versions, invalid standalone encoded bytes `\x80` to `\xFF` at the end of character class ranges will be treated as `\x7F`, rather than erroring. The edge case bugs described above won't be reproduced.
</details>

## Oniguruma version

From the first release until the latest version, `oniguruma-parser` follows the rules of Oniguruma 6.9.10 (released 2025-01-01), which uses Unicode 16.0.0.

Regex syntax in new releases of Oniguruma are generally backward compatible, containing only edge case bug fixes and new syntax that was previously an error (such as new Unicode property names).
